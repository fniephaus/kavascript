# Plush

Simple, minimalistic, dynamically-typed programming language for fun/didactic/tutorial purposes.

Design principles:
- The syntax should seem familiar and easy to understand to most
- The language semantics should be intuitive
  - Avoid undefined behaviors as much as possible
  - Avoid special cases, corner cases and hidden "automagic" behavior
- Keep the language intentionally small and easy to learn
- Aim for code that is well-commented and easy to read
  - Avoid one-liners and clever hacks
  - Try to make it easy for beginners to approach
- Minimize dependencies and in so doing, risk of code breakage
